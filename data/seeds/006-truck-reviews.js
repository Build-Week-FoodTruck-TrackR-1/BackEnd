Favorite tacos are the steak and chicken. The carne asada is cooked to perfection and the chicken is infused with bold flavors, put them both on the same plate next to radishes, grilled onion and a whole jalape√±o, fire!'},

        {diner_id: 3, truck_id: 1, star_rating: 4, review: 'Large taco and burrito truck.  Grab a variety of meaty tacos to go and eat in car or at home.  Lots of onions and cilantro and spicy salsa.'},
        {diner_id: 2, truck_id: 1, star_rating: 4, review: `Coming from San Diego, I feel as if it is really hard to find any good Mexican food outside of my home town. Anyway, I was expecting a lot from this place because I heard that this is the spot! And honestly, it's good and I loved the tacos! We ordered 2 al pastor tacos and then a carne asada burrito to share. Now, the reason I give 4 stars is solely because of the tacos. I loved them! The burrito on the other hand, didn't really spark anything different for me. I also ordered the burrito with no rice but there was rice in it anyway. Not a big deal, mistakes happen! But maybe I would've enjoyed it more. Also, parking is verryyyyyyy limited. (We had to wait in the parking lot to leave because someone was blocking us, LOL) But what can you expect in the bay?`},
        {diner_id: 2, truck_id: 7, star_rating: 5, review: "Forgot how much I love this place! Chicken tikka masala burrito is my go-to, I'm super uncomfortably stuffed if I eat the whole thing, but I can't seem to stop eating after just half. Last night we also tried the Lamb Quesadillix. My husband really liked it, and all its separate components too (the wrap, the lamb, the potatoes). I thought it was a bit too flavorful, but that's a hard thing to ding a fusion quesadilla on. I can't wait to come back, even if I'm supporting remotely through these Covid-19 times!"},
        {diner_id: 3, truck_id: 7, star_rating: 5, review: 'The menu is extensive. And the food was still hot when we unpacked it at home. Plus, super fresh flavors. Highly recommend.'},
        {diner_id: 1, truck_id: 7, star_rating: 4, review: "Curry up now never disappoints. It's Indian comfort food at its finest. They have unique fusion takes on Indian street food often resulting in yummy in the tummy creations."},

        {diner_id: 5, truck_id: 4, star_rating: 4, review: 'This place gets a bad rap but I don\'t think it\'s as bad as folks try to make it out. They are not the friendliest but being from the East Coast, that doesn\'t really bother me. I think the food is pretty decent. I would have given 3.7 so I\'m rounding up to 4 stars.'},
        {diner_id: 5, truck_id: 3, star_rating: 4, review: 'Food is pretty decent. Not the best but when you take price into consideration, that gets them a 4 in my book. Best bang for your buck in terms of Chinese food in the Bay'},

        {diner_id: 1, truck_id: 2, star_rating: 2, review: 'Not a big fan of this place. This is where all the gentrifiers get their tacos. This place has nothing on El Gordo in East Oakland'},

        {diner_id: 8, truck_id: 6, star_rating: 4, review: 'I\'m so happy for this new lunchtime option in the area! We needed some Indian food! I\'ve been here twice; once by myself and I had the butter chicken (delicious!), and the second time with my son and daughter-in-law and I had the chicken tikka masala (also delicious!). My son is vegetarian and his wife a vegan and we all found something to eat that we liked. Very flavorful, decent portions, reasonably priced, and fresh. The mango lassis are really good, too! Best of all, the people who run it are lovely and friendly and it really matters to them that you enjoy your food. They care about what they do and it shows!'},
        {diner_id: 3, truck_id: 6, star_rating: 5, review: 'Wow,Wow,Wow!!! The food and the service is impeccable! I\'m pescatarian and they have something for everyone. I\'ve had their curry shrimp, garlic naan, and vegan curry chicken. Going to try the vegan butter chicken for lunch today! I had never tried plant based chicken prior to this and it did not disappoint. The family that runs this place are so nice and engaging. The pregnant woman is always smiling and super sweet. I work a block away so will frequent this place at least 3x a week. Prices are comparable to portions but the flavors are worth much more!! A MUST try.. I highly recommend and they take Venmo'}
